# Broadleaf 4.0.1-GA

_Released on July 2, 2015_

This is the 1st patch release for the Broadleaf Commerce 4.0 framework.  This patch release focused primarily on fixes but also had a few small enhancements or improvements.

## Toggle Analytics Tracking via Ajax
An enhancement has been made to allow the disabling of analytics tracking during an ajax call.  The `trackAnalytics` option can be passed when making a call using the BLC.js library  For example, to disable analytics tracking during a GET call:

```
BLC.get({
  url : BLC.servletContext + "/myURL",
  trackAnalytics : false
}, function(data) {
  ...
}
```
