# Broadleaf 4.0.2-GA

_Released on July 31, 2015_

### Notice: This release contains an admin issue that prevents the association of a primary media asset when creating a new product.  We recommend skipping this release and instead upgrading to 4.0.3-GA.  All fixes/enhancements outlined below are still revelant and are also part of the 4.0.3-GA release.

This is the 2nd patch release for the Broadleaf Commerce 4.0 framework.  While this is a patch, there were several small enhancements made with this release.

# Noteworthy Updates

## Modals in the admin no longer close when losing focus
An enhancement has been made to the admin modal to prevent it from closing when clicking outside the modal focus.  The previous behavior could at times cause loss of data entered in form fields if the modal was accidently closed by clicking outside the focus of the modal.

## Proper merging of multiple XML metadata overrides
If Admin presentation properties are overriden by different xml configuration files on the same base entity they are now merged correctly.  Previous behavior took the properties from the last XML file override as the final merged version of the entity.

For example:

**First override from within a module**

```xml
<mo:override id="blMetadataOverrides">    
    <!-- Overriding _Product_ to exclude the quanityAvailable -->
    <mo:overrideItem ceilingEntity="org.broadleafcommerce.core.catalog.domain.Product">
        <mo:field name="defaultSku.quantityAvailable">
            <mo:property name="excluded" value="true" />
        </mo:field>
    </mo:overrideItem>
<mo:override>
```

**Then add an additional override from the core app**

```xml
<mo:override id="blMetadataOverrides">
    <!-- Another _Product_ override -->
    <mo:overrideItem ceilingEntity="org.broadleafcommerce.core.catalog.domain.Product">
        <mo:field name="displayTemplate">
            <mo:property name="excluded" value="true" />
        </mo:field>
    </mo:overrideItem>
</mo:override>
```

**Final merge brings both XML file overrides together**

```xml
<mo:override id="blMetadataOverrides">
    <mo:overrideItem 
    <!-- final _Product_ merge of all XML overridden fields -->
    ceilingEntity="org.broadleafcommerce.core.catalog.domain.Product">
        <mo:field name="defaultSku.quantityAvailable">
            <mo:property name="excluded" value="true" />
        </mo:field>
        <mo:field name="displayTemplate">
            <mo:property name="excluded" value="true" />
        </mo:field>
    </mo:overrideItem>
</mo:override>
```
