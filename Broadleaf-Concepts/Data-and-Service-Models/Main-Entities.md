# Main Entities

## <a name="wiki-product"></a> Product
This is the entity that the catalog revolves around and is used for browsing and searching. *Product* does not have any pricing information associated with it directly, but is available to the Product from its one-to-one relationship with a *Sku* (its "default *Sku*"). This one-to-one relationship is required, and *Products* cannot exist in the system without a link to a *Sku*.

## <a name="wiki-sku"></a> Sku
This entity has pricing information associated with it and is sold and added to the cart. One way to think about a *Sku* is to look at it as a particular, concrete representation of a *Product*. Because of this "concrete representation",  *Sku* has name, description, size, etc. Each *Product* needs at least 1 concrete representation of itself, which is why there is a required relationship between *Product* and its default *Sku*.

You can also have multiple concrete representations of a *Product*. Take an example of selling T-shirts. You might be selling a T-shirt with a certain picture on it: Let's call it a dog shirt. When you initially create the "dog shirt", you will give the default *Sku* a particular name, price, etc. However, you also want to offer this "dog shirt" in a variety of colors (e.g., blue, yellow, green) as well as a variety of sizes (e.g., small, medium, large). This would be represented by 9 additional *Skus*: A blue small dog shirt, a yellow small dog shirt, a green small dog shirt, etc. Each is related by *ProductOptions* and *ProductOptionValues*. A *ProductOption* in this example would be "Color" and "Size" whereas the *ProductOptionValues* would be "blue", "yellow", "green". In this example, a *Product* would then have 10 *Skus* related to it: 1 *Sku* that represents the default *Sku* (which is always required) and 9 other *Skus* represented by various sets of *ProductOptionValues*. This would allow you to have specific pricing (a blue XL dog shirt could be $2.00 more) and inventory constraints around each combination.

A *Sku* can also be a member of many *ProductBundles*, which is a subclass of *Product*. This relationship is achieved indirectly via *SkuBundleItem* where you can optionally set a discounted price for selling the *Sku* as a part of the bundle, as well as a quantity for how many of the *Sku* that you are offering in the bundle.

## <a name="wiki-order"></a>Order (cart)
*Orders* are obviously critical in eCommerce. While a Broadleaf *Order* does in fact represent a completed order with its associated payment information, shipping information, and items, that is only a portion of its full functionality. In fact, an *Order* that is "in process" is actually a shopping cart that is modified as items are added/updated/removed. Furthermore, orders that are in the "named" state correspond to the concept of a wishlist.
