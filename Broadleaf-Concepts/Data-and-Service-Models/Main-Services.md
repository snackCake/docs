## <a name="wiki-orderService"></a> OrderService

The `OrderService` interface and the default `OrderServiceImpl` implementation provide you with functionality to interact with orders and carts (they're the same -- check out [[Order (cart) documentation | Main Entities#wiki-order]] for more info). Methods are provided to create carts/wishlists; look them up from the persistence layer; add, remove, or update items; etc. Learn more about [[cart operations | Cart Operations]] and their workflows.
