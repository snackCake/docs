# REST Tutorials

## Background
Broadleaf Commerce uses Jersey which is the default implementation of JAX-RS, or Java API for RESTful Services. Jersey and JAX-RS make use of JAXB to marshal and unmarshal objects to/from from the client.  Jersey provides content negotiation, making use of the standard HTTP Accept and Content-Type headers.  By default Broadleaf accepts and marshals XML and JSON.  Broadleaf Commerce provides a number of service endpoints to allow for a rich suite of functionality including catalog browsing, cart and pricing operations, checkout, and order history.  All of the Broadleaf RESTful APIs can be extended, augmented, or replaced entirely.

The approach and design was meant to provide out-of-the-box services, but with the ability to extend the data model and override the business logic.  Rather than annotate each domain model with JAXB annotations we chose to use a wrapper concept.  This provided two major advantages:

1. Allows us to provide more coarse and aggregate APIs to RESTful API clients since the internal Broadleaf APIs and domain objects are likely too fine grained.

2. Allows us to override the marshaling and unmarshaling of data (allowing you to add or remove data that will be exposed, depending on your requirements.

## Important Note

If you are starting with the DemoSite project or the Eclipse workspace, all of the below steps have been implemented. All you have to do is add the `/WEB-INF/applicationContext-rest-api.xml` in your `patchConfigLocations` parameter of your web.xml, **above the /WEB-INF/applicationContext-security.xml**:


```xml
<context-param>
    <param-name>patchConfigLocation</param-name>
    <param-value>
        classpath:/bl-open-admin-contentClient-applicationContext.xml
        ...
        ...
        
        /WEB-INF/applicationContext-rest-api.xml
        /WEB-INF/applicationContext-security.xml
        /WEB-INF/applicationContext-filter.xml
        
        ...
        ...
    </param-value>
</context-param>
```

## Getting Started
In order to use Broadleaf's default RESTful services, all that is required is some configuration in your application's /WEB-INF/web.xml file.  You will need to define a new Servlet and Servlet mapping:

```xml
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>JerseyServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>
        com.sun.jersey.spi.spring.container.servlet.SpringServlet
    </servlet-class>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>JerseyServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/api/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

You'll notice several things here. First, the Servlet is a Jersey class that allows Spring Beans to be discovered and used as REST resources.  All of the dependency injection and AOP that that Spring components enjoy can be extended to Jersey-managed endpoints. Also, notice the Servlet mapping. It must be different than the Servlet mapping associated with the controller servlet (e.g. the Spring DispatcherServlet in the case of Spring MVC).  

In addition, you will have to make Broadleaf's default endpoints available to the Spring Application Context.  To do this, add the appropriate package to the component scan in your merged application context:

```xml
<context:component-scan base-package="org.broadleafcommerce.core.web.api"/>
```

> This component scan needs to be in one of the application contexts referenced in the `patchConfigLocations` parameter in your web.xml. You will run into problems if you instead put this scan into your applicationContext-servlet.xml.

This configuration is required to use Broadleaf's RESTful services and the most basic way to simply get Broadleaf's RESTful services working out of the box.

Lastly, it is recommended that you configure a filter to set the customer state, if known, on each request.  Broadleaf has a default filter that handles this.  You might want to replace it with your own implementation, especially if implementing some kind of security filter. To use Broadleaf's default filter out of the box, you must configure this filter in the merged application context.  Typically, we recommend using `applicationContext-security.xml`, if you are using the application as it is created with the Broadleaf Maven archetype.

```xml
<!-- Set up Spring security for the RESTful API -->
<sec:http pattern="/api/**" create-session="stateless">
    <sec:http-basic />
    <sec:custom-filter ref="blRestCustomerStateFilter" after="REMEMBER_ME_FILTER"/>
</sec:http>

<!-- Used for REST api calls.   This just takes in the passed in customerId and uses it to establish the customer. -->
<!-- Additional considerations MUST be made for implementations that are allowing external access to APIs. -->
<bean id="blRestCustomerStateFilter" class="org.broadleafcommerce.profile.web.core.security.RestApiCustomerStateFilter"/>
```

> **Note: Simply providing this security configuration will not secure your REST API. No URLs are secured with this configuration.** At a minimum, you will likely want to add:

```xml
<sec:intercept-url pattern='/**' access='ROLE_REMOTE' />
```

> as well as provide some type of security other than http-basic.

### Exception Handling

We have included a JAXRS provider that will auto-serialize the exceptions that could occur in your endpoints. Add this bean in a root applicationContext.xml (like `applicationContext-rest-api.xml`) to enable it:

```xml
<!-- This generic JAX-RS exception mapper can be commented out, and/or can be replaced with a custom 
     exception mapper or mappers.
     This MUST be marked as singleton. -->
<bean class="org.broadleafcommerce.core.web.api.BroadleafRestExceptionMapper" scope="singleton"/>
```

### Auto Type Selection

If you are using the endpoints that are out of the box but just want more information to be sent through them, you can add the following JAXRS `MessageBodyReaderWriter` bean for JAXRS to auto-select wrappers that you have overridden:

```xml
<!-- This adds (optional) support for serializing and deserializing Broadleaf extensions.  This can be commented out, especially if specifying 
     custom endpoint method signatures. If you've extended BLC API wrapper classes, then class does it's best to serialize the right information.  
     Deserialization does not always work, especially when polymorphic possibilities are involved.  In these cases, it is best to explicitly provide 
     specific method signatures (URIs) for each polymorphic type that will be deserialized.
     This MUST be marked as singleton. -->
<bean class="org.broadleafcommerce.core.web.api.BroadleafMessageBodyReaderWriter" scope="singleton"/>
```

## Running a Basic Checkout Scenario in Heat Clinic

If you've got the Heat Clinic Demo Site running and have enabled the REST API as instructed above,
you can use a REST client like Postman (http://www.getpostman.com/) to test a basic checkout flow outlined below:

1. Create a new cart:

`POST: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cart`

2. Add Product ID: 1 to the newly created cart. Note: this assumes that the customerId created above was 100

`POST: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cart/1?categoryId=1&customerId=100`

3. Add a Payment to the Order

`POST: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cart/checkout/payment?customerId=100`

Here is what a JSON representation of what an OrderPayment may look like. The REST API assumes that any Payment Gateway Communication or Processing is handled by the client. The REST API is intended to only handle the basic CRUD operations for payments on an order and the "handshake and communication between any Payment Provider" is handled outside the scope of the REST endpoint. Once you have received a successful Payment Response, you can then persist it to an order via an OrderPaymentWrapper like this:

```json
{
        "orderId": 1,
        "type": "CREDIT_CARD",
        "amount": "12.99",
        "currency": "USD",
        "gatewayType": "MY_GATEWAY",
        "transactions": [
            {
                "type": "AUTHORIZE_AND_CAPTURE",
                "rawResponse": "{\"attributes\": {\"blSandboxDisplayDateTimeDate\":\"01/22/2014\",\"javax.servlet.request.cipher_suite\":\"TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA\",\"blSandboxDisplayDateTimeMinutes\":\"22\",\"org.springframework.web.servlet.HandlerMapping.pathWithinHandlerMapping\":\"/null-checkout/hosted/return\",\"blSandboxDisplayDateTimeHours\":\"5\",\"javax.servlet.request.ssl_session_id\":\"52E052C494619fE503Dd29A590Ab184dDe3d1eE086Da2781Dc1c98646f962453\",\"org.springframework.web.servlet.HandlerMapping.bestMatchingPattern\":\"/null-checkout/hosted/return\"},\"parameters\": {\"MESSAGE\":\"Hosted Call Successful\",\"ORDER_ID\":\"2\",\"TRANSACTION_AMT\":\"12.99\",\"COMPLETE_CHECKOUT_ON_CALLBACK\":\"false\"}}",
                "success": true,
                "amount": "12.99",
                "currency": "USD",
                "additionalFields": [
                    {
                        "key": "MESSAGE",
                        "value": "Call Successful"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
}

```

4. Checkout

`POST: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cart/checkout?customerId=100`

5. Check the Order History for the Submitted Order

`GET: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders?customerId=100`

## Extending Broadleaf RESTful services
Extending Broadleaf Commerce is a big topic. Broadleaf's default entities can be extended. Broadleaf's DAOs and Services can also be extended.  See the section on [Extending Product](http://www.broadleafcommerce.com/docs/core/current/tutorials/core-tutorials/extending-entities-tutorial) or [Extending Service](http://www.broadleafcommerce.com/docs/core/current/tutorials/core-tutorials/extending-services-tutorial) for more information on generally extending Broadleaf's domain and service objects.  After extending the domain and/or services, you may want to expose the new data and/or functionality to clients of your RESTful API.  Broadleaf provides a mechanism for this and attempts to be as flexible as possible.

Perhaps the best way to describe how this works is to use an example.  Catalog-related entities are among the Broadleaf entities most often extended.  Broadleaf, for example, provides a entities for Category, Product, and Sku.  Let's assume that you are developing an eCommerce store to sell hot sauce.  You want to extend Broadleaf's Product to include the [Scoville Heat Units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale).  Again, you can find details on how to extend a Product [here](http://www.broadleafcommerce.com/docs/core/current/tutorials/core-tutorials/extending-entities-tutorial).  So, you create a new class called HotSauce:

```java
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.catalog.domain.ProductImpl;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Table;
import javax.persistence.Column;

@Entity
@Table("HOT_SAUCE")
public class HotSauce extends ProductImpl {

    @Column(name="SCOVILLE_UNITS")
    private Integer scovilleUnits;

    public void setScovilleUnits(Integer units) {
        this.scovilleUnits = units;
    }

    public Integer getScovilleUnits() {
        return this.scovilleUnits;
    }
}
```

Assuming that you have your JPA and necessary Spring configurations correct, your HotSauce class can be used as Broadleaf's "Product".  Let's assume that you want to expose the Scoville Units to Broadleaf's RESTful catalog API.  Let's also assume that you want to suppress the active start date and active end date that are exposed by default.  The key is to override the ProductWrapper that provides the data serialization:

```java
package com.mycompany;

import org.broadleafcommerce.core.web.api.wrapper.ProductWrapper;
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.*;

@XmlRootElement(name = "hotSauce")
@XmlAccessorType(value = XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class HotSauceWrapper extends ProductWrapper {
    @XMLElement
    private Integer scovilleUnits;

    @Override
    public void wrap(Product model, HttpServletRequest request) {
        //First, call the super method to get the default behavior
        super.wrap(model, request);
        //Next, cast the product passed in to HotSauce and use it to set the Scoville Units
        this.scovilleUnits = ((HotSauce)model).getScovilleUnits();
        //Last, suppress the active dates by setting them to null. Null values will not be serialized.
        super.activeStartDate = null;
        super.activeEndDate = null;
    }
}
```

In the merge configuration, you will also need to override the definition of this bean:

```xml
<bean id="org.broadleafcommerce.core.web.api.wrapper.ProductWrapper" class="com.mycompany.HotSauceWrapper" scope="prototype"/>
```

And that's it! Broadleaf's merge process will replace the default wrapper implementation with your HotSauceWrapper implementation.  Your wrap logic will control what gets serialized and what doesn't.  Any calls to get a HotSauce product will result in your wrapper class being instantiated and your wrap method being called. The Scoville Units will be returned as part of the message, and the active start and end dates will be suppressed.

## Creating your own RESTful services
In order to create a net new RESTful service, you simply need to implement an endpoint.  More information about JAX-RS is available [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/giepu.html). The important things to note are:

1. Make sure that your RESTful endpoint is a Spring-managed bean. This can be accomplished by using the @Component or @Service annotations, or by adding the bean to the merged application context via XML configuration.

2. Ensure that that the Spring-managed endpoint contains the necessary @Scope, @Path, @Produces, @Consumes annotations.

Here is an example:

```java
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import javax.annotation.Resource;

// The Java class will be hosted at the URI path "/myresource"
@Component("myEndpoint")
@Scope("singleton")
@Path("/myresource")
@Produces(value={MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.APPLICATION_XML})
@Consumes(value={MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.APPLICATION_XML})
public class MyNewEndpoint {

    @Resource(name = "myEntityService")
    private MyEntityService myEntityService;
    
    @GET
    @Path("/{id}")
    public MyResourceWrapper findMyResourceById(@Context HttpServletRequest req, @PathParam("id") Long id) {
        MyResourceWrapper wrapper = new MyResourceWrapper();
        MyEntity myEntity = myEntityService.findById(id);
        wrapper.wrap(myEntity, req);
        return wrapper;
    }
}
```

That is all that is required.  If this bean is registered with the Spring application context, either using a component scan or defining it directly in the merge application context XML file, and the web.xml file is modified as described above, then the new endpoint will be exposed as a RESTful service.

Here is the resource class that defines the object being returned:

```java
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.*;
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.web.api.wrapper.APIWrapper;

@XmlRootElement(name = "myResource")
@XmlAccessorType(value = XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class MyResourceWrapper implements APIWrapper<MyEntity>  {

    @XMLAttribute
    private Long id;

    @XMLElement
    private String name;

    @Override
    public void wrap(MyEntity model, HttpServletRequest request) {
        this.id = model.getId();
        this.name = model.getName();
    }
}
```

The key here is that the wrap method allows you to set the properties that are required to be serialized. Since they are annotated with JAXB annotations, they will be serialized as XML or JSON, depending on the Accept header of the request. Also notice that the HttpServletRequest is passed to the endpoint method and is made available to the wrap method. This is important if there is something from the request that is required to build the response (e.g. request URI used to build a new URL for content or media). In this example, we simply ignore the HttpServletRequest in the wrap method.  Also, if you make the wrapper class a Spring-managed prototype bean, you can have a number of additional benefits such as making it ApplicationContextAware, injecting services into it for further processing during wrapping, etc. If you do this, be sure it is prototype scoped, and that anything you do not wish to serialize is annotated as XMLTransient. Also be sure to use the application context to retrieve an instance. This is important because the endpoint is a singleton and the wrapper bean is a prototype:

```java
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextAware;
import javax.annotation.Resource;

// The Java class will be hosted at the URI path "/myresource"
@Component("myEndpoint")
@Scope("singleton")
@Path("/myresource")
@Produces(value={MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.APPLICATION_XML})
@Consumes(value={MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON, MediaType.APPLICATION_XML})
public class MyNewEndpoint implements ApplicationContextAware {

    private ApplicationContext context;

    @Resource(name = "myEntityService")
    private MyEntityService myEntityService;

    @Override
    public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException {
        this.context = applicationContext;
    }
    
    @GET
    @Path("/{id}")
    public MyResourceWrapper findMyResourceById(@Context HttpServletRequest req, @PathParam("id") Long id) {
        //Notice here that we use the application context to get the bean instance.  See the bean 
        //definition below. Notice the dependency injection.
        MyResourceWrapper wrapper = (MyResourceWrapper)context.getBean("myResourceWrapper");
        MyEntity myEntity = myEntityService.findById(id);
        wrapper.wrap(myEntity, req);
        return wrapper;
    }
}
```

```java
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.*;
import org.broadleafcommerce.core.web.api.wrapper.APIWrapper;
import org.broadleafcommerce.cms.file.service.StaticAssetService;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;
import javax.annotation.Resource;

@Component("myResourceWrapper")
@Scope("prototype")
@XmlRootElement(name = "myResource")
@XmlAccessorType(value = XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class MyResourceWrapper implements APIWrapper<MyEntity>  {

    @XMLTransient //We don't want to serialize this so we make it XMLTransient
    @Resource(name="blStaticAssetService")
    private transient StaticAssetService staticAssetService;

    @XMLAttribute
    private Long id;

    @XMLElement
    private String name;

    @XMLElement
    private String mediaUrl;

    @Override
    public void wrap(MyEntity model, HttpServletRequest request) {
        this.id = model.getId();
        this.name = model.getName();
        
        //Notice here we use an injected Broadleaf service to create the appropriate URL
        this.mediaUrl = staticAssetService.
            convertAssetPath(model.getMediaUrl(), request.getContextPath(), request.isSecure()));
    }
}
```
